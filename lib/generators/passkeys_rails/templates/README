===============================================================================

Depending on your application's configuration some manual setup may be required:

  1. Add a before_action to all controllers that require authentication to use.

     For example:

        before_action :authitencate_passkey!, except: [:index]

  2. Optionally include PasskeysRails::Authenticatable to the model(s) you are using as
     your user model(s).  For example, the User model.

  3. See the reference mobile applications for how to use passkeys-rails for passkey
     authentication.
